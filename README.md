# BlogDevelop
This project is a blogging platform developed using the Django framework. It enables users to create, publish, and manage blog posts. The platform includes essential features such as user registration and login, blog post creation, editing, and deletion, as well as the ability to display blog posts on the website.
# Structure
The application is built around several core Python files, each serving a distinct function:

main.py: Acts as the entry point for the application, setting up the Django environment.
models.py: Defines the database models for User, Post, and Comment, serving as the structure for database interaction.
views.py: Contains the logic for request handling, including user registration, login, logout, post creation, editing, deletion, as well as comment creation and editing.
forms.py: Handles form definition for user registration, login, and blog post creation, ensuring secure and efficient user input processing.
urls.py: Maps URLs to their corresponding views, directing the flow of web requests.
In addition to these Python files, the project includes template and static files to generate a rich user interface:

templates/: Contains HTML templates that outline the structure and appearance of the web pages.
static/: Houses static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files, enhancing the visual design and interactivity of the web pages.
