## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the application.

The 'models.py' file contains the User, Post, and Comment models.

The 'views.py' file contains the views for handling user registration, login, logout, post creation, post editing, post deletion, comment creation, comment editing, and comment deletion.

The 'forms.py' file contains the forms for user registration, login, post creation, post editing, and comment creation.

The 'urls.py' file contains the URL patterns for routing requests to the appropriate views.

The 'templates/' directory is used for storing HTML templates.

The 'static/' directory is used for storing static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
